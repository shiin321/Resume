            The project "CATCH THE MIDDLE LIGHT GAME!" was developed to explore
            the application of assembly language in conjunction with PIC16F84A
            microcontroller for learning purposes.<br />
            The code was adapted following a gaming format and demonstration to
            enhance understanding of the system's functionality. The project
            serves as a foundation for further development, potentially evolving
            into a security surveillance system. However, the creators
            acknowledge a limited knowledge in this field, leading to potential
            errors. The primary goal of this project is educational, focusing on
            the integration of assembly language and the use of PIC16F84A in a
            unique context. It aims to promote diversity in the application of
            assembly language and encourage broader utilization of the PIC16F84A
            microcontroller.

            Currently, a significant concern in the use of electric cars is the
            charging infrastructure. Many areas still lack sufficient charging
            stations, posing a challenge for widespread adoption. The issue
            becomes more severe as the popularity of electric cars continues to
            grow. However, this problem is being addressed through the
            development of smart roads that automatically charge vehicles. These
            intelligent roads utilize rotating blades and solar panels as
            sources of electricity generation. This innovative solution aims to
            alleviate the concerns associated with the charging infrastructure,
            making electric cars more feasible and accessible.

            This project involves developing a website for employees to request
            leave on a daily basis, with an approval or decline process by their
            supervisors. The leave request will only be considered successful
            upon approval from the respective supervisor. This website is
            intended for internal use and is exclusive to a specific company.
            Additionally, there will be a Human Resources department responsible
            for managing various employee data within the website.

            This project aims to present the creation of an automatic
            temperature measurement tool that measures, analyzes, and controls a
            system, aiming to simplify the complexity of writing and debugging
            computer programs. The central control will be facilitated by
            LabVIEW programming, serving as an intermediary for issuing
            commands, measuring, analyzing, and controlling the system. The
            system will utilize RTD/PT100 temperature sensor devices, and as
            these sensors start operating, data will be automatically
            transmitted back to the LabVIEW program. Users can conveniently and
            rapidly view the collected data or graphs in real-time, providing a
            user-friendly and efficient experience for data analysis and
            monitoring.
